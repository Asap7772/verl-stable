      "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about figuring out how many triangular brownie pieces with a base of 3 inches and height of 4 inches can be cut from a rectangular pan that's 15 inches by 24 inches. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to recall the strategies from the cheatsheet. The first note mentions using area to determine how many congruent shapes fit into a larger area. The formula for the area of a triangle is (1/2)*base*height. So, each triangle here has an area of (1/2)*3*4 = 6 square inches. \n",
      "\n",
      "The total area of the pan is length multiplied by width, so 15*24. Let me calculate that. 15 times 24... 15*20 is 300, and 15*4 is 60, so total is 360 square inches. \n",
      "\n",
      "If each triangle is 6 square inches, then the number of triangles would be the total area divided by the area of one triangle. So 360 divided by 6 is 60. But wait, the first note says to take the integer part of B/A, which would be 360/6 = 60, so 60 triangles. But maybe there's a catch here? Because sometimes when shapes are cut, there might be some wasted space due to alignment issues. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the second note, it says that if the dimensions must align with the container, partitioning the container into the same unit measures is important. So maybe the triangles can't be perfectly aligned, leading to some inefficiency. Let me think. The triangle has a base of 3 inches and height of 4 inches. If we try to fit them into the pan, how would they align?\n",
      "\n",
      "The pan is 15 inches by 24 inches. Let's consider the dimensions. If the base of the triangle is 3 inches, then along the 15-inch side, we can fit 15 / 3 = 5 triangles. Along the 24-inch side, the height is 4 inches, so 24 / 4 = 6. So if we arrange them in rows, each row would have 5 triangles, and there are 6 rows. That would give 5*6 = 30 triangles. But that seems way less than the area calculation. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the triangles are arranged. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the triangles are arranged such that their base is along the length and height along the width. But perhaps they can be placed in a way that each triangle takes up a certain space. Wait, but the area method gave 60, but the dimensional arrangement suggests maybe 30. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe the problem is that the triangles are not being arranged in a way that their dimensions fit perfectly. Let me think again. If each triangle has a base of 3 inches and height of 4 inches, then if you arrange them with their base along the length of the pan (15 inches) and height along the width (24 inches), then along the 15-inch side, you can fit 15 / 3 = 5 triangles. Along the 24-inch side, the height is 4 inches, so 24 / 4 = 6. So that would be 5*6 = 30 triangles. But each triangle is 6 square inches, so 30 triangles would take up 180 square inches, but the pan is 360. So that's half the area. That suggests that maybe the triangles are arranged in a way that they are not overlapping, but perhaps they are placed in a different orientation?\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the triangles are arranged in pairs. Because a triangle's area is 6, but if you have two triangles forming a rectangle, then each rectangle would be 3x4, which is 12 square inches. Then, if you arrange them as rectangles, you can fit more. Wait, but the problem says they are triangular pieces. So maybe each triangle is a right triangle? Because if you have a right triangle with legs 3 and 4, then the area is 6, and if you put two of them together, you get a rectangle of 3x4. \n",
      "\n",
      "So if you arrange the pan as a grid of 3x4 rectangles, then each rectangle can hold two triangles. Then the total number of rectangles would be (15/3) * (24/4) = 5 * 6 = 30 rectangles. Each rectangle gives two triangles, so 30*2=60 triangles. That matches the area calculation. So that would be 60 triangles. But how does that fit with the dimensions?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the pan is 15 inches by 24 inches. If each rectangle is 3x4, then along the 15-inch side, you can fit 15 / 3 = 5 rectangles. Along the 24-inch side, 24 / 4 = 6. So 5*6=30 rectangles. Each rectangle can be split into two triangles, so 30*2=60 triangles. That makes sense. So the area method gives 60, and the dimensional arrangement also gives 60. So that's consistent. \n",
      "\n",
      "But why did I initially think 30? Because I was considering only one triangle per rectangle. But if each rectangle can be split into two triangles, then that's the key. So the answer would be 60. \n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the problem says the pan is cut into triangular pieces. So maybe the triangles are arranged in such a way that they fit without overlapping. So the area method is correct here, but the dimensional arrangement also confirms it. \n",
      "\n",
      "But let me check the third note in the cheatsheet. It says that using the gcd of the dimensions. Wait, no, the third note is the cheatsheet. The third note is the problem. The third note is the example. \n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the problem is to find the number of triangles in the grid. Wait, no, the problem is about the brownie pan. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that the triangles can be arranged in such a way. For example, if the pan is 15x24, and the triangles are 3x4, but arranged in a way that their base and height are aligned. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the triangles are arranged with their base along the 15-inch side and their height along the 24-inch side. But if each triangle has a base of 3 and height of 4, then along the 15-inch side, you can fit 15 / 3 = 5 triangles. Then, along the 24-inch side, each triangle takes up 4 inches, so 24 / 4 = 6. So each row would have 5 triangles, and there are 6 rows. So that's 5*6=30 triangles. But that's only if each triangle is placed in a single row. However, if you arrange them in pairs, as I thought before, then you can fit two per rectangle. \n",
      "\n",
      "But how can that be? Because if each triangle is placed with base 3 and height 4, then two triangles can form a rectangle of 3x4. So in that case, the pan can be divided into 3x4 rectangles, each of which can be split into two triangles. So the total number is 30 rectangles * 2 = 60 triangles. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the area calculation is correct here, and the dimensional arrangement also gives the same answer. \n",
      "\n",
      "But then why does the second note mention partitioning into unit squares? Because in this case, the dimensions of the pan are multiples of the triangle's base and height. So the pan can be divided into 3x4 rectangles, which are the same as the dimensions of the triangles when arranged as pairs. \n",
      "\n",
      "So the answer should be 60. \n",
      "\n",
      "But let me check again. The area of the pan is 15*24=360. Each triangle is 6. 360/6=60. So that's the answer. \n",
      "\n",
      "But maybe there's a mistake here. For example, if the triangles are not arranged in such a way that they perfectly fit, but the problem says they are cut from the pan. So the key is that the pan is a rectangle, and the triangles are right triangles with legs 3 and 4. So if you arrange them in pairs, each pair forms a 3x4 rectangle. Then, the pan can be divided into 3x4 rectangles. \n",
      "\n",
      "So the pan is 15x24. 15 divided by 3 is 5, and 24 divided by 4 is 6. So 5*6=30 rectangles. Each rectangle gives two triangles, so 60. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the answer is 60. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem says \"cut into triangular pieces\". So maybe the triangles are arranged in such a way that they fit perfectly. Therefore, the area method is valid here. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the triangles can't be arranged in pairs, but that's not the case. Because two right triangles can form a rectangle. So if the pan is divided into 3x4 rectangles, each can be split into two triangles. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the answer is 60. \n",
      "\n",
      "But let me check if there's any other constraints. For example, maybe the triangles can't be arranged in that way. But according to the problem, the pan is rectangular, and the triangles are of base 3 and height 4. So if they are arranged in pairs, then yes, it's possible. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the triangles are not right triangles. But the problem doesn't specify, but the area is given as base times height divided by two. So regardless of the type of triangle, as long as the base and height are 3 and 4, the area is 6. \n",
      "\n",

So, the question is about figuring out how many triangular brownie pieces with a base of 3 inches and height of 4 inches can be cut from a rectangular pan that\\'s 15 inches by 24 inches. \\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the strategies from the cheatsheet. The first note mentions using area to determine how many congruent shapes fit into a larger area. The formula for the area of a triangle is (1/2)*base*height. So, each triangle here has an area of (1/2)*3*4 = 6 square inches. \\n\\nThe total area of the pan is length multiplied by width, so 15*24. Let me calculate that. 15 times 24... 15*20 is 300, and 15*4 is 60, so total is 360 square inches. \\n\\nIf each triangle is 6 square inches, then the number of triangles would be the total area divided by the area of one triangle. So 360 divided by 6 is 60. But wait, the first note says to take the integer part of B/A, which would be 360/6 = 60, so 60 triangles. But maybe there\\'s a catch here? Because sometimes when shapes are cut, there might be some wasted space due to alignment issues. \\n\\nLooking at the second note, it says that if the dimensions must align with the container, partitioning the container into the same unit measures is important. So maybe the triangles can\\'t be perfectly aligned, leading to some inefficiency. Let me think. The triangle has a base of 3 inches and height of 4 inches. If we try to fit them into the pan, how would they align?\\n\\nThe pan is 15 inches by 24 inches. Let\\'s consider the dimensions. If the base of the triangle is 3 inches, then along the 15-inch side, we can fit 15 / 3 = 5 triangles. Along the 24-inch side, the height is 4 inches, so 24 / 4 = 6. So if we arrange them in rows, each row would have 5 triangles, and there are 6 rows. That would give 5*6 = 30 triangles. But that seems way less than the area calculation. Wait, that can\\'t be right. Wait, maybe I\\'m misunderstanding how the triangles are arranged. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the triangles are arranged such that their base is along the length and height along the width. But perhaps they can be placed in a way that each triangle takes up a certain space. Wait, but the area method gave 60, but the dimensional arrangement suggests maybe 30. There\\'s a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\\n\\nWait, maybe the problem is that the triangles are not being arranged in a way that their dimensions fit perfectly. Let me think again. If each triangle has a base of 3 inches and height of 4 inches, then if you arrange them with their base along the length of the pan (15 inches) and height along the width (24 inches), then along the 15-inch side, you can fit 15 / 3 = 5 triangles. Along the 24-inch side, the height is 4 inches, so 24 / 4 = 6. So that would be 5*6 = 30 triangles. But each triangle is 6 square inches, so 30 triangles would take up 180 square inches, but the pan is 360. So that\\'s half the area. That suggests that maybe the triangles are arranged in a way that they are not overlapping, but perhaps they are placed in a different orientation?\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the triangles are arranged in pairs. Because a triangle\\'s area is 6, but if you have two triangles forming a rectangle, then each rectangle would be 3x4, which is 12 square inches. Then, if you arrange them as rectangles, you can fit more. Wait, but the problem says they are triangular pieces. So maybe each triangle is a right triangle? Because if you have a right triangle with legs 3 and 4, then the area is 6, and if you put two of them together, you get a rectangle of 3x4. \\n\\nSo if you arrange the pan as a grid of 3x4 rectangles, then each rectangle can hold two triangles. Then the total number of rectangles would be (15/3) * (24/4) = 5 * 6 = 30 rectangles. Each rectangle gives two triangles, so 30*2=60 triangles. That matches the area calculation. So that would be 60 triangles. But how does that fit with the dimensions?\\n\\nWait, the pan is 15 inches by 24 inches. If each rectangle is 3x4, then along the 15-inch side, you can fit 15 / 3 = 5 rectangles. Along the 24-inch side, 24 / 4 = 6. So 5*6=30 rectangles. Each rectangle can be split into two triangles, so 30*2=60 triangles. That makes sense. So the area method gives 60, and the dimensional arrangement also gives 60. So that\\'s consistent. \\n\\nBut why did I initially think 30? Because I was considering only one triangle per rectangle. But if each rectangle can be split into two triangles, then that\\'s the key. So the answer would be 60. \\n\\nBut wait, the problem says the pan is cut into triangular pieces. So maybe the triangles are arranged in such a way that they fit without overlapping. So the area method is correct here, but the dimensional arrangement also confirms it. \\n\\nBut let me check the third note in the cheatsheet. It says that using the gcd of the dimensions. Wait, no, the third note is the cheatsheet. The third note is the problem. The third note is the example. \\n\\nBut wait, the problem is to find the number of triangles in the grid. Wait, no, the problem is about the brownie pan. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe there\\'s a mistake in assuming that the triangles can be arranged in such a way. For example, if the pan is 15x24, and the triangles are 3x4, but arranged in a way that their base and height are aligned. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the triangles are arranged with their base along the 15-inch side and their height along the 24-inch side. But if each triangle has a base of 3 and height of 4, then along the 15-inch side, you can fit 15 / 3 = 5 triangles. Then, along the 24-inch side, each triangle takes up 4 inches, so 24 / 4 = 6. So each row would have 5 triangles, and there are 6 rows. So that\\'s 5*6=30 triangles. But that\\'s only if each triangle is placed in a single row. However, if you arrange them in pairs, as I thought before, then you can fit two per rectangle. \\n\\nBut how can that be? Because if each triangle is placed with base 3 and height 4, then two triangles can form a rectangle of 3x4. So in that case, the pan can be divided into 3x4 rectangles, each of which can be split into two triangles. So the total number is 30 rectangles * 2 = 60 triangles. \\n\\nTherefore, the area calculation is correct here, and the dimensional arrangement also gives the same answer. \\n\\nBut then why does the second note mention partitioning into unit squares? Because in this case, the dimensions of the pan are multiples of the triangle\\'s base and height. So the pan can be divided into 3x4 rectangles, which are the same as the dimensions of the triangles when arranged as pairs. \\n\\nSo the answer should be 60. \\n\\nBut let me check again. The area of the pan is 15*24=360. Each triangle is 6. 360/6=60. So that\\'s the answer. \\n\\nBut maybe there\\'s a mistake here. For example, if the triangles are not arranged in such a way that they perfectly fit, but the problem says they are cut from the pan. So the key is that the pan is a rectangle, and the triangles are right triangles with legs 3 and 4. So if you arrange them in pairs, each pair forms a 3x4 rectangle. Then, the pan can be divided into 3x4 rectangles. \\n\\nSo the pan is 15x24. 15 divided by 3 is 5, and 24 divided by 4 is 6. So 5*6=30 rectangles. Each rectangle gives two triangles, so 60. \\n\\nTherefore, the answer is 60. \\n\\nBut the problem says \"cut into triangular pieces\". So maybe the triangles are arranged in such a way that they fit perfectly. Therefore, the area method is valid here. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the triangles can\\'t be arranged in pairs, but that\\'s not the case. Because two right triangles can form a rectangle. So if the pan is divided into 3x4 rectangles, each can be split into two triangles. \\n\\nTherefore, the answer is 60. \\n\\nBut let me check if there\\'s any other constraints. For example, maybe the triangles can\\'t be arranged in that way. But according to the problem, the pan is rectangular, and the triangles are of base 3 and height 4. So if they are arranged in pairs, then yes, it\\'s possible. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the triangles are not right triangles. But the problem doesn\\'t specify, but the area is given as base times height divided by two. So regardless of the type of triangle, as long as the base and height are 3 and 4, the area is 6. \\n\\nSo the answer is 60. Therefore, the final answer should be \\\\boxed{60}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo determine how many triangular pieces with a base of 3 inches and a height of 4 inches can be cut from a rectangular pan measuring 15 inches by 24 inches, we follow a systematic approach using both geometric reasoning and area-based calculations.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Area of One Triangle**\\n\\nEach triangular piece has a base of 3 inches and a height of 4 inches. The area $ A $ of a triangle is given by:\\n\\n$$\\nA = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\times \\\\text{base} \\\\times \\\\text{height}\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\nA = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\times 3 \\\\times 4 = 6 \\\\text{ square inches}\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Area of the Pan**\\n\\nThe pan is a rectangle with dimensions 15 inches by 24 inches. The total area $ B $ of the pan is:\\n\\n$$\\nB = 15 \\\\times 24 = 360 \\\\text{ square inches}\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Step 3: Use Area to Estimate the Number of Triangles**\\n\\nIf we assume that the triangles can be arranged without any wasted space, the number of triangles that can be cut is the total area of the pan divided by the area of one triangle:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{Number of triangles} = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{360}{6} \\\\right\\\\rfloor = 60\\n$$\\n\\nThis is the **theoretical maximum** assuming perfect packing. However, we must also consider **geometric alignment** and whether the triangles can actually fit in the pan without leaving gaps or overlapping.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Step 4: Check for Geometric Feasibility**\\n\\nEach triangle has a base of 3 inches and a height of 4 inches. We can check how many such triangles can fit along the dimensions of the pan:\\n\\n- **Along the 15-inch side**: $ \\\\frac{15}{3} = 5 $ triangles per row\\n- **Along the 24-inch side**: $ \\\\frac{24}{4} = 6 $ rows\\n\\nThis gives a total of $ 5 \\\\times 6 = 30 $ triangles if placed in a single orientation. However, this assumes that each triangle is placed individually, which would only cover half the area of the pan.\\n\\nBut if we consider that **two right triangles can form a rectangle of 3x4**, then:\\n\\n- Each 3x4 rectangle can be split into **2 triangles**\\n- The pan can be divided into $ 5 \\\\times 6 = 30 $ such 3x4 rectangles\\n- Each rectangle gives 2 triangles, so total number of triangles is $ 30 \\\\times 2 = 60 $\\n\\nThis confirms that the **area-based calculation is valid** and that the triangles can indeed be arranged to perfectly fit the pan.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Conclusion**\\n\\nBoth the area-based calculation and the geometric arrangement confirm that **60 triangular pieces** can be cut from the pan without any wasted space.\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\boxed{60}\\n$$\\n'}"

      "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about figuring out how many triangular brownie pieces with a base of 3 inches and height of 4 inches can be cut from a rectangular pan that's 15 inches by 24 inches. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to recall the strategies from the cheatsheet. The first note mentions using area to determine how many congruent shapes fit into a larger area. The formula for the area of a triangle is (1/2)*base*height. So, each triangle here has an area of (1/2)*3*4 = 6 square inches. \n",
      "\n",
      "The total area of the pan is length multiplied by width, so 15*24. Let me calculate that. 15 times 24... 15*20 is 300, and 15*4 is 60, so total is 360 square inches. \n",
      "\n",
      "If each triangle is 6 square inches, then the number of triangles would be the total area divided by the area of one triangle. So 360 divided by 6 is 60. But wait, the first note says to take the integer part of B/A, which would be 360/6 = 60, so 60 triangles. But maybe there's a catch here? Because sometimes when shapes are cut, there might be some wasted space due to alignment issues. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the second note, it says that if the dimensions must align with the container, partitioning the container into the same unit measures is important. So maybe the triangles can't be perfectly aligned, leading to some inefficiency. Let me think. The triangle has a base of 3 inches and height of 4 inches. If we try to fit them into the pan, how would they align?\n",
      "\n",
      "The pan is 15 inches by 24 inches. Let's consider the dimensions. If the base of the triangle is 3 inches, then along the 15-inch side, we can fit 15 / 3 = 5 triangles. Along the 24-inch side, the height is 4 inches, so 24 / 4 = 6. So if we arrange them in rows, each row would have 5 triangles, and there are 6 rows. That would give 5*6 = 30 triangles. But that seems way less than the area calculation. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the triangles are arranged. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the triangles are arranged such that their base is along the length and height along the width. But perhaps they can be placed in a way that each triangle takes up a certain space. Wait, but the area method gave 60, but the dimensional arrangement suggests maybe 30. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe the problem is that the triangles are not being arranged in a way that their dimensions fit perfectly. Let me think again. If each triangle has a base of 3 inches and height of 4 inches, then if you arrange them with their base along the length of the pan (15 inches) and height along the width (24 inches), then along the 15-inch side, you can fit 15 / 3 = 5 triangles. Along the 24-inch side, the height is 4 inches, so 24 / 4 = 6. So that would be 5*6 = 30 triangles. But each triangle is 6 square inches, so 30 triangles would take up 180 square inches, but the pan is 360. So that's half the area. That suggests that maybe the triangles are arranged in a way that they are not overlapping, but perhaps they are placed in a different orientation?\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the triangles are arranged in pairs. Because a triangle's area is 6, but if you have two triangles forming a rectangle, then each rectangle would be 3x4, which is 12 square inches. Then, if you arrange them as rectangles, you can fit more. Wait, but the problem says they are triangular pieces. So maybe each triangle is a right triangle? Because if you have a right triangle with legs 3 and 4, then the area is 6, and if you put two of them together, you get a rectangle of 3x4. \n",
      "\n",
      "So if you arrange the pan as a grid of 3x4 rectangles, then each rectangle can hold two triangles. Then the total number of rectangles would be (15/3) * (24/4) = 5 * 6 = 30 rectangles. Each rectangle gives two triangles, so 30*2=60 triangles. That matches the area calculation. So that would be 60 triangles. But how does that fit with the dimensions?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the pan is 15 inches by 24 inches. If each rectangle is 3x4, then along the 15-inch side, you can fit 15 / 3 = 5 rectangles. Along the 24-inch side, 24 / 4 = 6. So 5*6=30 rectangles. Each rectangle can be split into two triangles, so 30*2=60 triangles. That makes sense. So the area method gives 60, and the dimensional arrangement also gives 60. So that's consistent. \n",
      "\n",
      "But why did I initially think 30? Because I was considering only one triangle per rectangle. But if each rectangle can be split into two triangles, then that's the key. So the answer would be 60. \n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the problem says the pan is cut into triangular pieces. So maybe the triangles are arranged in such a way that they fit without overlapping. So the area method is correct here, but the dimensional arrangement also confirms it. \n",
      "\n",
      "But let me check the third note in the cheatsheet. It says that using the gcd of the dimensions. Wait, no, the third note is the cheatsheet. The third note is the problem. The third note is the example. \n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the problem is to find the number of triangles in the grid. Wait, no, the problem is about the brownie pan. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that the triangles can be arranged in such a way. For example, if the pan is 15x24, and the triangles are 3x4, but arranged in a way that their base and height are aligned. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the triangles are arranged with their base along the 15-inch side and their height along the 24-inch side. But if each triangle has a base of 3 and height of 4, then along the 15-inch side, you can fit 15 / 3 = 5 triangles. Then, along the 24-inch side, each triangle takes up 4 inches, so 24 / 4 = 6. So each row would have 5 triangles, and there are 6 rows. So that's 5*6=30 triangles. But that's only if each triangle is placed in a single row. However, if you arrange them in pairs, as I thought before, then you can fit two per rectangle. \n",
      "\n",
      "But how can that be? Because if each triangle is placed with base 3 and height 4, then two triangles can form a rectangle of 3x4. So in that case, the pan can be divided into 3x4 rectangles, each of which can be split into two triangles. So the total number is 30 rectangles * 2 = 60 triangles. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the area calculation is correct here, and the dimensional arrangement also gives the same answer. \n",
      "\n",
      "But then why does the second note mention partitioning into unit squares? Because in this case, the dimensions of the pan are multiples of the triangle's base and height. So the pan can be divided into 3x4 rectangles, which are the same as the dimensions of the triangles when arranged as pairs. \n",
      "\n",
      "So the answer should be 60. \n",
      "\n",
      "But let me check again. The area of the pan is 15*24=360. Each triangle is 6. 360/6=60. So that's the answer. \n",
      "\n",
      "But maybe there's a mistake here. For example, if the triangles are not arranged in such a way that they perfectly fit, but the problem says they are cut from the pan. So the key is that the pan is a rectangle, and the triangles are right triangles with legs 3 and 4. So if you arrange them in pairs, each pair forms a 3x4 rectangle. Then, the pan can be divided into 3x4 rectangles. \n",
      "\n",
      "So the pan is 15x24. 15 divided by 3 is 5, and 24 divided by 4 is 6. So 5*6=30 rectangles. Each rectangle gives two triangles, so 60. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the answer is 60. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem says \"cut into triangular pieces\". So maybe the triangles are arranged in such a way that they fit perfectly. Therefore, the area method is valid here. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the triangles can't be arranged in pairs, but that's not the case. Because two right triangles can form a rectangle. So if the pan is divided into 3x4 rectangles, each can be split into two triangles. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the answer is 60. \n",
      "\n",
      "But let me check if there's any other constraints. For example, maybe the triangles can't be arranged in that way. But according to the problem, the pan is rectangular, and the triangles are of base 3 and height 4. So if they are arranged in pairs, then yes, it's possible. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the triangles are not right triangles. But the problem doesn't specify, but the area is given as base times height divided by two. So regardless of the type of triangle, as long as the base and height are 3 and 4, the area is 6. \n",
      "\n",
      "So the answer is 60. Therefore, the final answer should be \\boxed{60}.\n",
